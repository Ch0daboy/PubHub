AS LONG AS THERE ARE TASKS IN THE TASK LIST, DO NOT STOP WORKING.
IF THE USER WANTS YOU TO STOP WORKING, THEY WILL LET YOU KNOW.
THERE  IS NO NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION TO WORK.
IF  THERE ARE NO TASKS IN THE TASK LIST,  THEN REFACTOR THE CODE AND  LOOK FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE THE CODE. BUT ONLY AFTER ALL TASKS ARE COMPLETED.

FOLLOW THIS BASIC WORKFLOW

1.Firstcheck both your todo list and your task-master task list  before doing anything else so you have an idea of the task at hand and the bigger picture.
2.If there is no tasks in the task list, then analyze the code base and look for ways to improve it and create a new task list. Otherwise continue with steps 3-6.
3.Before beginning any task always ask yourself if the task can be broken down into smaller tasks, if so, then create a to do list for it.
4.Continue to break down every task until it is just ONE file to edit. Never attempt to make multiple edits at the same  time
5.after creating or  editing a file update your to do list and your task-master task list  if applicable.
6.After updating these lists, run the  /clear command to help manage context size.


Whenever you implement a new feature or add functionality verify it is implemented and didnt break anything else by running tests.
When testing,  make sure to use playwright to test the front end ui as well, take screenshots of your  work and evaluate it.
Use google gemini api whenever the project calls for use of AI, do not use any other AI unless absolutely necessary. google gemini can generate text, images, video, audio.
Use git worktree instead of using other branches
When planning larger tasks usecontext7 and ref mcp servers to  make sure youy have up to date info
